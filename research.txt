Company Stack Research


1. Identify 3 software or technology companies the interest you.

2. Conduct research to figure out some or all of the elements of each company’s technology stack. Check job openings/job descriptions, engineering blogs, and anything else that may have information about what the company uses to write/build it’s software products.

3. Record your findings in a google doc. If you can find information about why the company chose that stack, include that as well.

4. Create a new text file called research.txt and include the link to your Google doc inside.
